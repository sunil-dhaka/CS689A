One can notice that we have many useful suffixes from the whole corpus.
For example we see that the suffix like
िया
ियों 
ियाँ 
िये 
ियी 
ियां 
can be used to create different form of the word, like बचाइया (saved), बचाइयों (saved), बचाइयाँ (saved), बचाइये (saved), बचाइयी (saved), बचाइयां (saved)

similarly we have
़ा
़े
़ी
़ों
़ने
़ीं
़े
can be used to create different form of the word, like ब़ाज़ारा (sold), ब़ाज़ारे (sold), ब़ाज़ारी (sold), ब़ाज़ारों (sold), ब़ाज़ारने (sold), ब़ाज़ारीं (sold), ब़ाज़ारे
--------------------

Even from a small news article we can see that these suffixes are very useful to create different form of the word.
